'''
The volume of a circular cylinder (such as a solid metal pipe) is calculated from the following formula:

πr²h

That is, it's π * r * r * h

Given the following starter code, fill in the blanks so that this program prints the correct volume for the cylinder describes in variables!
'''

pi = 3.14
r = 2
h = 10

cylinder_volume =  pi * r * r * h
print(f"The volume of a cylinder with radius {r} and height {h} is {cylinder_volume}")
